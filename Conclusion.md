# Conclusion

The logistic of the main calculate probability function has been tested multiple times, both on small self created data and on the final dataset we are currently using. The outcome of this function is expected. The outputs from using real data is very interesting. For example, "Donald Trump is the president" is a "Lie", but "Donald Trump is the president of the United States" is "Truth". The accuracy of this agent is not very high. But it is considered hard to identify lies in poltical statements even for a human, political statements are usually lways debateble and have some parts of it being correct and other parts being either fake or exaggerated. Yet there are further improvements that can be made to increase the accuracy. One way of doing it is to update the training data as the user enters more inputs, as stated in the Abstract of this project. Another way is to consider the conditional probability of the valid words in the user input, given whether the statements they are in together are lies or not.
